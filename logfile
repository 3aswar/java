GitHub is primarily used as a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It is a popular tool among developers, software engineers, and project managers to manage and track changes to their code repositories.

With GitHub, users can create repositories to store and share their code with others, and they can collaborate on projects with other developers by cloning, branching, and merging code. GitHub also provides tools for issue tracking, code review, and project management, making it a complete solution for software development.

Beyond software development, GitHub can also be used for documentation, data analysis, and other collaborative projects that involve tracking changes to files over time. Its popularity and accessibility have made it a key platform for open-source projects, making it easy for developers worldwide to contribute to and collaborate on projects of all sizes.
